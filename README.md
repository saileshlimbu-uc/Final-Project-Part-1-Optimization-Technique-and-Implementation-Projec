High-Performance Computing (HPC) Optimization Project
Overview
This project demonstrates optimization techniques for data structures in the context of High-Performance Computing (HPC). Specifically, we focus on implementing cache optimization to improve data locality and reduce cache misses in a Python program. This project provides a small prototype that showcases the benefits of the chosen optimization technique.

Features
Implements cache optimization to minimize memory access latency.
Demonstrates the benefits of optimized data structures for improved performance in HPC.
Simple Python-based implementation that is easy to follow and modify.
Includes performance analysis and comparison of results before and after optimization.
Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. You can check this by running:

bash
Copy code
python --version
If Python is not installed, you can download it from the official Python website.

Installing Pip
If pip is not installed on your system, follow these steps to install it:

Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
Download the get-pip.py file:
bash
Copy code
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
Run the script to install pip:
bash
Copy code
python get-pip.py
Installation
To install the dependencies required for the project, you can use pip. Follow the steps below:

Clone this repository:



Results
After running the program, the performance improvements before and after cache optimization will be displayed. You can compare the execution times and analyze how the optimization has enhanced performance.
